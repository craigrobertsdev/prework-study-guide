# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project demonstrates that I am able to follow instructions to produce a basic web site using the languages of the web.

The motivation for this was to ensure that I am ready for the coding bootcamp's main content and to record the things I learnt during the pre-work.

This site both solves the issue of forgetting important aspects of the pre-work and, when viewing the developer console, assists in suggesting what to learn next.

In building this project, I learnt about the correct git workflow and the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
